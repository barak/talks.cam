<!--

NOTE: This rudimentary XML interface is still experimental and not very robust,
and hence is not ready for widespread adoption at the moment.

To create a new talk, edit and send this XML document as a:

* HTTP POST request
* to http://(hostname)/talk/update
* and include the following HTTP headers:
Content-Type: application/xml
Accept: application/xml
* See below for how to send your username and password (authenticate)

Please note that ALL fields are mandatory, except "special-message".
Make sure that the document is well-formed XML before POSTing.

The response should either be a redirection to the succesfully created
talk, or else a redirection to the login page if the credentials were
wrong.

== AUTHENTICATION ==

To authenticate, you can

1) EITHER use "Basic Authentication" (non-Raven ONLY)
  see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication

2) OR send a cookie, copied from your browser; e.g. send a header like this:
Cookie: _session_id=fb6b2d8c80196499f2196446b5a1964f

Session Cookies will work with both Raven and non-Raven logins, so long
as you are still logged-in in your browser, and your session hasn't expired.

* IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT RAVEN *

Basic Authentication will NOT work with Raven logins, and furthermore will NOT
be transmitted securely, so don't risk having your Raven details intercepted by
accidentally sending them using Basic Auth!
